8-queens problem is problem, where the goal is to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard such
that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. This is a specific case of the N-queens problem,which involves place N queens on an NxN chessboard. Not all N's have solutions: there's a (trivial!) solution for N=1, no solution for 2 and 3, but there are solutions for N=4

Solve it using successor functions and try what happens if you use different successor functions
